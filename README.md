## Description

Before I made my portfolio, I used an Html template. And it was limited and generic. Therefore, I made my own to improve my web development skills. I started developing as I took a web development course called Internet Technologies in the final semester of my bachelor's computer science degree at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University.
