## Why I made it
Before I made my portfolio, I used an Html template. And it was limited and generic. Therefore, I made my own. I started developing my own as I took a web development course called Internet Technologies in the final semester of my bachelor's computer science degree at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University.
## What I used
### Stack
- [NextJS/React] - The front-end framework.
- [TypeScript] - Adds static typing to JavaScript.
- [ThreeJS] - A general purpose 3D library.
- [Tailwind CSS] - A CSS utility framework.
- [Framer Motion] - React animation library.
### Tools
- [MagicaVoxel] - Voxel art editor.
- [Blender] - Editing and animating 3D graphics.
